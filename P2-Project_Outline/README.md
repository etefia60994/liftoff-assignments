# Project Outline
Project Outline

Overview

My project will be an intake form for case managers to use when pairing clients with various social services that they are eligible for. This will significantly reduce the working hours that  case managers spend going through the service provider information and increase the speed at which clients receive help. Staff members will be able to  create case files with client information such as income, zip code, number of dependents, and age  while having the data be stored in a database
This project was motivated by the need of a nonprofit organization that wants a way to assist their Community Outreach Department in meeting the needs of their clients.

Features

Create and edit clients/service providers: Some users will be able to create new clients/service providers in the system by entering in a mixture of required (name, income, dependents, etc) and optional fields (zip code, gender, etc)
View recent clients: Users will be able to view a listing of recent clients, and by clicking on a recent client view details about that client.
Client Deletion: Users will be able to delete clients.

Technologies

What I'll Have to Learn

I will need to learn how to use the React framework for the front end portion of my project. I will have to learn MongoDB. I'll also be using test-driven development, writing tests for my code before writing the code itself. I don't have much experience doing this in Spring, so I'll have to learn how to use its testing capabilities.
